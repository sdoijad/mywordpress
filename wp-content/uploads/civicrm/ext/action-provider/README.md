## Releasing Process

When one of the admins think it is time to relase a new version they might do so. You can also ask them to release a new version.
Usually this when the release is being tested and put in production.

For admins creating a release those are the steps to follow:

1. Update info.xml to reflect the new version number and release date
2. Remove the 'not yet released' from CHANGELOG.md
3. Copy the changes
4. Go to tags, create a new tag and paste the changes
5. After that update info.xml to add a new version number ending with _-dev_
6. Update changelog add a heading for the new version with the text _not yet released_
