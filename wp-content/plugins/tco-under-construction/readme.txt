Got a little work that needs to be done under the hood? Say hello to the easiest maintenance plugin youâ€™ll ever setup.

== Description ==

Setting up a maintenance plugin shouldn't be a hassle. With Under Construction, you can easily activate a notice to anyone who isn't logged in with the click of the mouse. It's also incredibly easy to configure and provides plenty of flexibility. Go as minimal as you want: Or you can add a little color and a countdown timer if you'd like. Colors are customizable for all elements. Additionally, you can include links to your main social network profiles if you'd like so that your visitors can keep up with things while you move stuff around. You can even place background images on your maintenance page, making the options truly endless for what you can create!
